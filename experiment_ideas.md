#Ideas for experiments

In general finding out wat is means to evaluate the same model with Cellular Automatons
Possibly we need to do multiple runs to derive a distribution

In general investigate:
* scalability on log scale, keep the field sqaure in order to maintain same characteristics 
 * that is gridsize 10x10	= 100
 * that is gridsize 30x30	= 900
 * that is gridsize 100x100	= 10 000
 * that is gridsize 300x300	= 90 000
 * that is gridsize 1000x1000	= 1 000 000

per model investigate
* investigate $R_t$ daily repo rate
*


Inspect variables
* infection rate
